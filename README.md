# Probability_Case_Study
This case study demonstrates how different probability concepts work in real-world data analysis using:

Marginal Probability

Joint Probability

Conditional Probability

Independent & Dependent Events

By applying these concepts to the weather dataset, I analyzed how conditions like Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind influence the likelihood of “Play = Yes/No.”
